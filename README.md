GNC Caseload Calculator

There are two versions of the GNC Calculator archived in the GitHub. 
1. GNC_Calculator_DEV_Unimodal (assumes there is only one peak of acute malnutrition during the year)
2. GNC_Calculator_DEV_Temperature (allows for two peaks or more of acute malnutrition during one year)

It can be difficult to identify the peak month of acute malnutrition and the amplitude of seasonal variation of acute malnutrition over one year. To simplify this step of the analysis, we can drawn from current analyses.  

There are studies that show clearly that the prevalence of acute malnutrition is correlated with temperature in the Africa Drylands of East Africa, Chad, Niger and the Sahel of West Africa. One new paper - Peak timing of slowest growth velocity among young children coincides with highest ambient temperatures in Burkina Faso: a longitudinal study  from Burkina Faso shows a similar pattern.  These data were collected from Sanmatenga Province, Burkina Faso between August, 2014, and December, 2016.  In this paper, the mean z-score for weight for height is inversely correlated with temperature. The increasing temperature is correlated with illness, water quality, water availability, food security and caring practices. 

In the GNC_Calculator_DEV_Temperature, the inputs of peak month of acute malnutrition correspond to the average peak temperature by month. This allows a similar estimation as to what is included in the articles above.  For those who use this version, please closely review the inputs and outputs of the calculator.  It would be helpful to compare the estimates of monthly acute malnutrition to the admissions to the management of SAM programme.
