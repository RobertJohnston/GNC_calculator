GNC Caseload Calculator

There are two versions of the GNC Calculator archived in the GitHub. 
1. GNC_Calculator_DEV_Unimodal (assumes there is only one peak of acute malnutrition during the year)
2. GNC_Calculator_DEV_Temperature (allows for two peaks or more of acute malnutrition during one year)

Identifying the peak month of acute malnutrition and the seasonal variation amplitude can be challenging. However, existing studies show a clear link between acute malnutrition prevalence and temperature in the African Drylands, including East Africa, Chad, Niger, and the Sahel. A paper from Burkina Faso (Sanmatenga Province, 2014–2016) confirms that the lowest growth velocity in young children coincides with peak temperatures, with weight-for-height z-scores inversely related to temperature. Rising temperatures are also linked to illness, water issues, food security, and childcare practices.

The GNC_Calculator_DEV_Temperature uses average peak temperatures by month as proxies for peak malnutrition months, aligning with these findings. Users should carefully review the calculator’s inputs and outputs and compare its estimates to actual SAM admissions data.
