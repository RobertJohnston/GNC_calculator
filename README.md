GNC Caseload Calculator
There are two draft versions of the GNC Calculator archived in GitHub.
1.	GNC_Calculator_DEV_Temperature (allows the peaks of acute malnutrition to follow patterns defined by peak temperature during the year)
2.	GNC_Calculator_DEV_Unimodal (assumes there is one or no peak of acute malnutrition during the year)

The instructions for data entry into the calculator are included in the spreadsheet.

Identifying the peak month of acute malnutrition and the seasonal variation amplitude can be challenging. However, existing studies show a clear link between acute malnutrition prevalence and temperature in the African Drylands , including East Africa, Burkina Faso,  Chad, Niger, and the Sahel. In these studies, the lowest weight-for-height z-scores are associated with the highest average peak temperature. Higher temperatures are also linked to child mortality, increased incidence of child illnesses, water issues, food security, and poorer childcare practices.

The GNC_Calculator_DEV_Temperature uses average peak temperatures by month as proxies for peak malnutrition months, aligning with these findings. Users should carefully review the calculatorâ€™s inputs and outputs and compare its estimates to actual SAM admissions data.

When using temperature as a factor to identify seasonal variation of wasting, users need to calculate the average national peak temperature by month for the population. In many countries, this will demand a population weighted estimate of the temperature.
